## Overview ‚ú®

Lightling Labs is a full-stack application currently in development as part of my personal web developer portfolio! It's both a learning playground and a project with heart. It is centered around creative independence, cultural grounding, and tech empowerment!

**Core ideas:**

- AI assisted brand name suggestions & taglines
- Curated brand mood/color selections
- Responsive UI with handcrafted styling (no utility frameworks)
- Built with growth and future features in mind
